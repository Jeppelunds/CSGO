    <h2>Operations</h2>

    <p>Operations are a form of DLC introduced in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive consisting of community created content including community maps, a purchasable operation coin, & a lot of content from Valve like Co-Op Strike or Guardian missions. Starting with Operation Breakout, pass owners had the privilege of participating in missions. Missions are released in a timely schedule, with players starting out able to complete a limited number of missions, but will gain more missions to complete after a period of time, and the amount of missions the player can do accumulates over time. When the player activates a mission, they will automatically launch a find game for the required game mode for the mission.</p>

    <p>Operations since Operation Shattered Web also introduced exclusive weapon collections, stickers, graffiti, patches, & cases. Earlier operations were scheduled to last between 2-5 months with a one month break inbetween, though the past three operations have lasted around 20 weeks. Some operations have been extended to give players additional time to complete missions & claim rewards. Since operations contain community created content, a portion of the proceeds go directly to authors of content included within the operation. Regardless of new operations being released, new weapon cases & capsules can still be released during an operation. For example, the Dreams & Nightmares Case which was released during Operation Riptide.</p>

<div class="skins-info">
<p>Skins, also referred to as finishes, are a feature exclusive to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, introduced in the Arms Deal update. They are weapons with different textures that can be equipped in-game. They are entirely cosmetic, holding no gameplay function.</p>
<h3>StatTrak™</h3>
<p>StatTrak™ is a weapon quality which tracks the number of kills performed by the owner of the weapon. StatTrak™ kills do not transfer between users when the item is traded. StatTrak™ kills can be converted to another StatTrak™ weapon of the same class through a StatTrak™ Swap Tool.</p>
<h3>Wear rating</h3>
<p>A float is chosen when a weapon skin is dropped, unboxed or received from a trade up contract. The float simulates a randomized condition on the skin. The rarity of the float is based on a bell curve for most weapons, with low float Factory New items and high float Battle-Scarred items being the rarest[2]. The closer it is to 0, the cleaner the skin is. The closer it is to 1, the more worn it appears.</p>
<h3>Pattern templates</h3>
<p>Based on the finish style used, the same skin may have different looks due to variations with texture offset and displacement. This information is stored in a visible pattern index seed between 1 & 1000.[3]

    There are many interesting seeds for various weapon finishes and some are more sought after than others. This drives the price of specific items with specific items up in value. A good example of this is the AK-47 - Case Hardened. Patterns with lots of blue are known as "blue gems" and are typically more expensive.</p>
